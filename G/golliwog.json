        "The Golliwogg was a black character in children's books in the late 19th century usually depicted as a type of rag doll. It was produced as a children's toy called the \"golliwog \", and had great popularity in North America, Europe and Australia up to the 1970s. The doll is characterised by black skin, eyes rimmed in white, large red lips, and frizzy hair. In recent years, changing attitudes when it comes to race relations have greatly reduced the popularity and sales of golliwogs as toys. The Golliwogg is seen as a very racist depiction of black people in the same vein as Mammies , black face and Picaninnies. This , along with the fact that \"Wog\" is a pejorative term for people of african descent have made the Golliwogg a socially unacceptable toy."
