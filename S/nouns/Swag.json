        "A word that was extremely overused from late 2010 to early 2012, and is now nothing more than a joke. The word swag once had many meanings, such as Stuff we all get, Scientific wild ass guess, and even just stolen goods.",
        "This day in age, saying swag in a non-sarcastic way in public will probably just end up getting your ass beat, as it is no longer in style, even for preppy teenfags. The term is still used by internet trolls, and as a joke, but that's about it."
